Kun security centers on bound identity, least-privilege brokers, protected consent, and bounded resources. It can constrain SDK/Broker calls, isolate Webviews and extension state, and contain one extension's failure. It cannot turn arbitrary Node `main` code into a malicious-code security sandbox.

## Trust model

### Source trust

Installation review shows source type/locator, `publisher.name`, version, SHA-256, signature status, contributions, and permissions. A signature is provenance evidence, not proof of a Kun security audit. Unsigned local/index packages may be installed only after explicit confirmation and remain marked unsigned.

### Execution trust

| Type | Trust meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Declarative contribution | Host renders only validated text, icons, Schemas, and command references |
| Webview | Chromium sandbox + context isolation + Node off + narrow bridge; no direct network by default |
| Node `main` | Runs with current-user OS privileges; child process is reliability isolation only |
| `hostContentScripts` | Can read/change visible workbench DOM; isolated world does not prevent UI spoofing/content reading |

Installing Node/Direct DOM code means trusting it with those real capabilities. Broker permissions cannot prevent Node from directly using `fs`, `net`, `child_process`, and similar APIs. Management UI and documentation continue to disclose this limitation.

### Workspace trust

Packages install globally and enable per workspace. Every operation is also constrained by current workspace trust/scope. A global permission grant does not authorize every workspace. Workspace changes close ineligible Views/content scripts and cancel or reject out-of-scope calls.

### Per-operation trust

File writes, command execution, external effects, and secret reveal may still require the Kun ApprovalGate or Host-owned protected consent. An extension cannot self-approve or replace real consent with Agent text, a Webview click, or DOM mutation.

## Permission enforcement

Manifest permissions are exact strings; see [Manifest](./manifest.en.md#permissions). General rules:

1. Installation or a version with added permissions displays them in a protected surface.
2. Grants bind exact extension ID, version permission snapshot, and workspace policy.
3. The Host connection binds real identity; a payload extension ID is not authorization input.
4. Every operation rechecks current grants, not only activation/registration.
5. A request may narrow but never expand grants.
6. Revocation immediately blocks new calls; in-flight calls cancel/fail under capability rules.
7. One extension's threads, state, accounts, private commands, View Sessions, and content-script worlds are inaccessible to another by default.

`accounts.secrets.read:<providerId>` and `hostDom` are high-risk permissions that require renewed consent when added. `workspace.write`, `tools.register`, and `providers.register` also cannot override stricter core policy.

## Protected surfaces

Only independent protected windows owned by Electron Main/core may handle:

- installation, upgrade, permission changes, package source review;
- workspace trust;
- credential/secret entry and secret reveal;
- OAuth callback completion;
- external-side-effect approval;
- other security-critical consent.

These windows mount no extension Webview, inject no content script, and render no plugin HTML. After a real user decision, Main authorizes with a short-lived, single-use, operation-bound token. It binds extension/version, kind, parameter digest, workspace, window session, and expiry and is never given to the plugin. Forgery, replay, expiry, or changed parameters fail.

## Storage types

| Type | Permission | Scope | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global State | `storage.global` | extension ID | Cross-workspace preferences, lightweight cache metadata |
| Workspace State | `storage.workspace` | extension ID + workspace | Project configuration/progress |
| View State | `webview`/View contract | extension + contribution + workspace | UI expansion, filters, cursors |
| Credential Store | Account Broker | Provider + account + credential reference | API keys, OAuth tokens, secrets |

The first three accept only Schema-valid, quota-bounded structured data and are not secret stores. Binary blobs, large logs, complete prompts/attachments, and credentials are forbidden in state. Account secrets belong only in Credential Store.

Package directories are immutable and are not state directories. Mutable data defaults to:

```text
~/.kun/extension-data/<publisher.name>/
  state/
  backups/
  logs/
```

`host-health.json` under the same data root stores non-secret restart/circuit Host health; extensions must not edit it directly.

The host may explicitly override its data root. Do not hard-code this path or directly read across namespaces; use SDK APIs.

## State writes and migration

- Writes pass Schema, size/quota, and scope checks.
- Host persistence is safe/atomic and does not expose partial commits.
- A `stateSchemaVersion` upgrade backs up every global/workspace namespace.
- All namespaces migrate before atomic switch; mixed versions are forbidden.
- Rollback uses a compatible retained snapshot and never infers reverse migration.
- Uninstall preserves state by default; data deletion requires separate confirmation.

Avoid meaningless write churn from timestamps/random values. Large caches need bounds, TTL, and cleanup.

## Network Broker

Prefer an exact `network:<hostname>`. When multiple subdomains are genuinely required, explicitly declare `network:*.example.com`. For example:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "network:api.example.com"
  ]
}
```

The Broker checks:

- HTTPS scheme and target hostname;
- every DNS result and the actual socket target for each production direct request;
- every redirect target;
- extension/workspace/account scope;
- method, headers/body Schema;
- timeout, response bytes, concurrency, rate;
- cancellation and audit/redaction.

The production default transport accepts only public-unicast addresses for remote HTTPS. If one resolution contains any loopback, private, link-local, unique-local, multicast, reserved, IPv4-mapped special-use, or other non-public-unicast address, the complete request fails closed; one simultaneous public address does not make a mixed answer safe. The Broker gives the validated address set directly to that request's socket lookup, so connection does not adopt a changed DNS answer. The next request resolves and validates again. Explicit `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, and `http://[::1]` work only when every resolved address is loopback.

Redirect handling is always manual/error. After accepting a `Location`, the caller starts a new Broker request so scheme, permission, DNS, account, and credential-host policy all run again for the next hop. Production Network/Account Brokers do not inherit ambient HTTP(S) proxies because proxy-side resolution cannot satisfy this direct-connection pinning contract; any future explicit proxy integration must provide equivalent validation. An explicitly injected fake `fetch` in tests does not represent this production guarantee.

An exact hostname grant allows no subdomain. `network:*.example.com` matches subdomains only and does not also match the apex `example.com`; declare both when needed. A wildcard does not relax address classification, although the same hostname resolving to different public-unicast addresses across requests is normal DNS behavior. Never put tokens in URLs/queries. Webview direct `fetch`/WebSocket remains CSP-blocked. Node direct network can bypass the Broker, so these controls are not an OS sandbox for Node code and cannot guarantee that a public upstream will not proxy to another target itself.

## Authenticated Fetch

Pass only an account reference. Account Broker refreshes and injects authentication, rejects/removes conflicting plugin credential headers, and strips authorization/cookie material from the returned response. Secret-read is only for an approved Node custom signer; see [Providers and accounts](./providers-and-accounts.en.md#authenticated-fetch-and-secret-read).

## Workspace access

`workspace.read`/`workspace.write` authorize broker operations only under granted roots. Paths are normalized and guarded against traversal/symlink escape. A write may still trigger sandbox/ApprovalGate; permission does not mean “no confirmation required.”

An Agent Run/tool can request only a narrower workspace scope than its grant. After workspace trust/permission revocation, the next file operation fails even if the Run/catalog predates revocation.

## Default runtime limits

v1 Host baseline defaults follow. User/platform policy may tighten them. Read effective values from diagnostics/capabilities and never hard-code assumptions:

| Resource | Default |
| --- | --- |
| One IPC message | 1 MiB |
| Activation deadline | 15 seconds |
| General operation deadline | 60 seconds |
| Cancellation grace | 2 seconds |
| Shutdown deadline | 5 seconds |
| Concurrent operations per extension | 16 |
| Stream window | 32 unacknowledged events or 4 MiB |
| Host event rate | 200 events/second |
| Node Host memory ceiling | 256 MiB |
| Consecutive-crash circuit threshold | 3 |
| Log rotation | 5 MiB × 3 files per stream policy |
| Extension state document | 10 MiB |
| State migration deadline | 30 seconds |
| Network/authenticated request body | 8 MiB |

State, network responses, Agent events, and tool output have more specific public Schema/policy limits. A breached limit returns a stable structured error; do not evade it with unbounded queues or retries.

See [Packaging](./packaging-and-index.en.md#package-validation-limits) for `.kunx` defaults.

## Backpressure and release

- Producers wait for stream acknowledgement and never pre-buffer complete results.
- Queues have both item and byte limits.
- Lagging subscribers reconnect durable events with a cursor.
- Cancellation/terminal releases buffers, timers, listeners, and correlation.
- Disable/uninstall fences new calls before cancel/deactivate.
- Memory/protocol limits terminate or circuit-break only the owning extension.

## Logs

Kun captures extension stdout, stderr, and Host lifecycle logs, attributed by extension ID, version, and process instance, with rotation:

```bash
kun extension logs acme.issue-assistant
kun extension logs acme.issue-assistant --json
```

Log operation/request/invocation IDs, state changes, elapsed time, bounded error codes, retryability, and resource limits. Never log:

- API keys, access/refresh tokens, OAuth/device codes, client secrets;
- cookies or authorization headers;
- runtime or consent tokens;
- complete prompts, attachments, or file content;
- unbounded request/response bodies.

Core also redacts Provider errors containing known secrets, but extensions must sanitize before writing stdout. A crash report after secret-read must not contain the secret.

## Diagnostics and audit

```bash
kun extension doctor acme.issue-assistant
```

Without secrets, diagnostics expose selected/installed version, source/digest/signature, enablement, permission snapshot, Manifest/API/Kun/RPC negotiation, state schema, active Host PID, activation cause, restart/circuit state, limit failures, last structured error, and log location.

Audit attributes Agent/tool/Provider/account/secret/network/consent operations to extension, version, workspace, non-secret resource reference, operation, and outcome. Output is safe to attach to a bug report by default, but still review business metadata before public sharing.

## Author security checklist

- Default to browser-only; add Node `main` only for real background needs.
- Declare the minimum hostname/account/workspace/UI permissions.
- Never store secrets in state, settings, logs, or messages.
- Never import private Kun paths, IPC, or bearer tokens.
- Use Host account/network/file APIs instead of implementing them in a Webview.
- Bound every stream, queue, cache by bytes/items/time.
- Make cancellation/disposal idempotent; discard late post-terminal results.
- Declare external effects accurately; never auto-retry unknown outcomes.
- Disclose complete Provider request access and prohibit fallback.
- Prefer stable contributions/Webviews over Direct DOM.
- Before release, test redaction, denial, crash paths, `doctor`, and the release checklist.

# Kun Graph Mode architecture and operations

Graph Mode is a per-turn Kun orchestration strategy, not a second agent
runtime. `direct` keeps the existing chat path. In `graph`, a Lead converts the
request into a lightweight intent that the host compiles into a validated execution graph, Kun schedules constrained
workers in the background, and the Lead supervises material events, reviews
evidence, and produces one final delivery. The Lead is the original primary
agent that created the Graph. It owns both process and result quality, actively
inspects live worker sessions, waits briefly and rechecks, and guides drift or
missing deliverables.

The detailed Chinese guide is [graph-mode.md](./graph-mode.md).

## System boundary

Graph Mode has three separable planes:

1. Execution: plans, runs, nodes, attempts, typed edges, resource accounting,
   captured results, reviews, scheduling, and recovery. Legacy mailbox and
   artifact events remain readable for persisted runs.
2. Project capability: versioned Agent profiles, Skill and Graph Recipe
   candidates, routing, scores, and evidence.
3. Governance: candidates, probation, promotion, dormancy, archival, merge,
   rollback, deletion, and audit.

The product still has one path:
`Renderer -> preload -> main -> kun serve HTTP/SSE`. The renderer does not run
the scheduler or invent state transitions. Existing direct turns,
`delegate_task`, and the older `task_graph` remain compatible. Workers cannot
delegate recursively, control graphs, govern profiles, or expand parent
authority. Learned assets stay under the Kun data directory unless the user
explicitly exports them.

### Graph Lead mode system contract

Graph mode is not an ordinary agent with a few extra tools attached. Whenever
a turn selects `graph`, Kun injects the same system-authority Graph Lead
contract into every model request, including initial creation, active
supervision, event-driven resumes, and terminal delivery. The contract:

- identifies the original primary agent as the source Lead responsible for
  outcome, process, worker quality, remediation, integration, and validation;
- requires the understand, create, supervise, validate, repair, integrate, and
  terminal-deliver operating loop;
- treats child sessions, text, and artifacts as untrusted evidence that cannot
  override host validation or expand authority;
- requires live-session inspection, risk-based short waits, immediate guidance
  for drift, and a later check that the correction actually happened;
- distinguishes dispatch, milestone prose, and claimed argument fixes from
  persisted Graph and tool truth; and
- permits final delivery only after terminal state, required nodes,
  Lead-approved handoffs, integration, and checks are satisfied.

The contract is a separate mode system instruction after the stable Kun
system prompt. Direct turns therefore remain direct, while every resumed
Graph round retains the full Lead identity and obligations.

## Execution lifecycle

```text
Graph turn
  -> a Plan-sidebar launch embeds the complete saved Markdown in the source request
  -> Lead selects auto, fanout_join, pipeline, bounded_loop, state_machine, or hybrid
  -> Lead calls graph_create_run with focused task intent
  -> host derives durable plan mechanics, validates, and journals GraphPlan
  -> scheduler computes ready nodes
  -> immutable least-authority assignment snapshot
  -> DelegationRuntime child executor
  -> workers proactively report progress, findings, questions, risks, and early results
  -> the source Lead uses graph_supervise_node overview, then inspects, waits, or guides as needed
  -> only after the current episode is handled may the Lead release its execution slot and park
  -> executor finishes normally; host captures its response and durable child session
  -> deterministic/peer evidence plus mandatory source Lead pass or revise
  -> a Lead pass releases the bounded data-result packet; otherwise repair, retry, GraphPatch, or LoopGate
  -> material signals resume the same Lead for inspection, reporting, remediation, or reassignment
  -> final gates and resource disposition
  -> completed, failed, or cancelled GraphRun
  -> the same Lead turn performs final delivery and only then terminates
  -> sanitized Episode and asynchronous learning
```

A GraphRun outlives any individual model request or network stream, but it
remains owned by its source Lead turn. While nodes run, the host parks only the
process-local execution and releases model concurrency; the durable turn stays
`running`. Material events resume that exact `sourceTurnId`. The turn becomes
terminal only after the GraphRun is terminal and the Lead has delivered the
final outcome. Native Graph Lead turns use the GraphRun wall-time and resource
ledger rather than ordinary direct-turn step and wall-time limits; explicit
extension budgets still apply. On reconnect the renderer reconciles an HTTP
snapshot, then resumes SSE after its acknowledged cursor.

GUI Plan files under `.kunsdd/plan` may be untracked and therefore absent from
isolated Git worktrees. Graph creation also requires `graph_create_run` before
ordinary read tools. The Plan sidebar consequently embeds the exact saved
Markdown in the source request. The Lead builds from that copy and gives every
executor a self-contained objective instead of assigning a snapshot node to
reread the GUI-only path.

## Contracts and state

Contracts live in `kun/src/contracts/graph.ts` and `graph-agents.ts`, with
explicit versions. `GraphPlanV1` describes topology and policy;
`GraphRunV1` is the durable projection; `GraphNodeAttemptV1` records an
immutable execution snapshot; `GraphEventEnvelopeV1` supplies monotonic
sequence, revision, command, and idempotency metadata. `GraphPatchV1`,
captured executor results, reviews, legacy messages/artifacts, cleanup, profile
versions, evidence, Episodes, candidates, and audit records are strict schemas.

Edge kinds are:

- `control`: outcome-gated scheduling;
- `data`: a named result packet exposed to the successor only after the source
  Lead accepts the predecessor;
- `message`: a legacy persisted edge shape. New executors have no peer mailbox
  tools; cross-node information must use a Lead-approved data handoff.

The compiled plan also records the resolved execution strategy. `fanout_join`
leaves independent siblings ready together; `pipeline` chains real
accepted-result dependencies; `bounded_loop` uses an explicit LoopGate;
`state_machine` represents explicit state transitions while keeping cycles
bounded; and `hybrid` mixes parallel and serial regions in one run. `auto`
infers the strategy only from an already explicit task topology. All strategies
compile to the same ready-set scheduler, so one run can fan out, join, proceed
serially, and fan out again.

Run states progress from `draft -> validating -> ready -> running`, with
pause, supervision, and human-review branches, then
`completing -> completed`; `failed` and `cancelled` are terminal. Nodes move
from pending/blocked through ready, queued, running, submitted, reviewing, and
accepted, with repair, failure, cancellation, skip, and supersession branches.
The reducer rejects an event whose declared source state differs from durable
truth. Accepted history is immutable.

## Validation, revisions, and loops

The host validates identity, references, reachability, completion paths, edge
kinds, assignments, scopes, reviews, risk, and every configured non-token resource limit.
Ordinary dependencies must be acyclic. A logical cycle is valid only inside a
strongly connected component with an explicit bounded LoopGate.

GraphPatch uses compare-and-swap with `baseRevision`, `expectedRevision`, and
`expectedSeq`. A stale request has no partial effect. A valid patch is fully
revalidated and committed as one revision while accepted facts remain as
superseded history.

A LoopGate declares a condition source, continuation, exit and exhaustion
targets, and maximum iterations. Every continuation
writes `loop_iteration_advanced`, resets only the host-computed cycle nodes,
preserves prior attempts, creates attempts at a new iteration, and increments
the run ledger. Unfinished lifecycle states have no outcome: a pending,
blocked, ready, queued, running, submitted, or reviewing condition source
cannot trigger a failed branch or evaluate a LoopGate. Exhaustion can never
create another attempt. Repeated identical
normalized failures pause or escalate.

## Scheduling, limits, and cancellation

The host scheduler resolves dependencies and failure propagation, applies
priority and retry delay, and enforces:

- maximum concurrent runs;
- global and per-run concurrent nodes;
- attempts and capped exponential retry;
- run and node wall time;
- revisions, loops, messages, and artifact bytes.

The default GraphRun wall-time limit is seven days. The separate host-enforced
node limit remains 24 hours, and 15 minutes of quiet activity triggers a
supervision inspection without aborting the node.
The create tool may omit the entire `budget` or any individual mechanical
field. The host fills node/edge, concurrency, attempt, revision, loop,
run/node wall-time, message, artifact, and `warningRatio` values from current
Graph configuration. A plan supplies a field only when the user or project
intentionally asks for a narrower limit; every explicit value still passes
host-maximum validation.

Token usage is recorded for cost attribution and learning evidence only. Graph
plans, nodes, loops, and immutable worker assignments have no token ceiling,
and the scheduler never pauses, fails, warns, or suppresses work because of
token count.

Runs rotate fairly. Node timeout is enforced with a host AbortSignal. Cancel
first fences the run as terminal, aborts and waits for active workers, discards
late results, settles attempts and nodes, releases leases, safely disposes
worktrees, and records cleanup. Repeated cancellation and cleanup are
idempotent.

## Authority and worker context

Every attempt freezes profile/version/origin, model/provider/reasoning,
system instructions, tools, Skills, MCP servers, approval, sandbox, workspace,
read/write scopes, network, and time limits. Effective authority is the
intersection of parent, graph, profile, node, and host policy.

Executors never receive delegation, Graph
creation/control/patch/review/supervision, governance, or any legacy
`graph_worker_*` tool. They receive ordinary tools authorized by the frozen
assignment plus the single host-owned `report_to_parent` capability. Their context contains the objective, acceptance criteria, scopes,
bounded repair feedback, prerequisite status, and only the named result
packets that the source Lead has already approved for this node. Control edges
convey readiness only. It excludes the full Lead history, peer mailbox
content, unrelated node results, and Lead/user-private artifacts.

An executor is not told the run, node, attempt, edge, mailbox, or artifact-store
protocol. `report_to_parent` infers those identities and the sole Lead
recipient from the active child session. Progress is persisted without waking
the Lead; findings, questions, risks, and early results trigger coalesced
supervision. Reports are advisory and cannot accept work or advance the graph.
The executor still finishes with a normal concise response
covering result, changed files, checks, evidence, and risks. Kun automatically
captures that response and retains the canonical child session. Retries receive
bounded host-validation errors and Lead repair feedback, but never an
instruction to publish or submit Graph state.

Worker model policy defaults to `inherit`, freezing the source Lead provider,
model, and reasoning effort into the attempt. Settings may select a `fixed`
default for implicit workers. An explicit authorized node/profile assignment
still wins, and any fixed selection outside the frozen parent model authority
fails closed before launch. Configuration changes affect future attempts only.

## Review, writes, and completion

Review policies can add deterministic, peer, human, or combined evidence, but
every executable node always requires an explicit review from the owning
source Lead. Kun never synthesizes that Lead vote through a worker, peer
reviewer, or scheduler transition. A peer is a different child instance and
critical risk can additionally require a human. A pass vote cannot override
`validation.valid === false`; genuine missing evidence, failed checks, and
scope errors must be repaired before the Lead can accept an attempt. Absence
of a worker Graph-tool call is not a validation error.

Supervision is event driven for submission, failure, stall, conflict, resource-limit,
help, recovery, completion, user steering, and material worker reports. Normal progress does not poll a
model. Signals coalesce and resume or steer the original source Lead with
`messageSource: graph_runtime`; new-format runs do not create replacement
background Lead turns. The Lead has `graph_supervise_node`: `overview` pages
across every node with latest attempt, activity, report, and a small transcript
tail; `inspect` reads a
bounded, sanitized, cursor-based child transcript; `wait` performs an abortable
1-60 second wait and fresh inspection; and `guide` durably records
attempt-targeted guidance, acknowledges answered blocking questions, and then
steers the active child turn when possible.
Each continuation inspects durable truth and relevant live sessions, chooses
an activity-appropriate cadence such as a 30-second recheck, guides drift, and
verifies corrections before parking again. When an executor finishes, the
same Lead inspects the captured result and child session and calls
`graph_review_node` with pass or revise. Until a valid Lead pass exists, the
node stays under supervision and every successor remains blocked.

The Lead pass is also the data handoff. The host projects a bounded packet
under the data edge's semantic name, including the accepted summary, changed
files, checks, evidence, risks, and optional artifact references. Workers
never relay results directly to peers or advance edges themselves.

When required or completion work exhausts automatic attempts, the scheduler
keeps dependants blocked, moves the run to `awaiting_supervision`, and wakes the
same Lead. It does not skip the rest of the graph or immediately make the run
terminal. The Lead can inspect evidence, guide and retry, rebind, patch, or
cancel honestly. Completion, failure, and cancellation all trigger one final
delivery.

Write nodes declare normalized repository-relative scopes. `serialize`,
`lease`, and optional Git `worktree` policies prevent unsafe overlap.
Worktrees capture staged binary patches including new, deleted, and empty
files, verify every changed path against the immutable lease, and apply safely
with stale/dirty/conflict checks. Unknown user changes require human
disposition. Unaccepted, conflicted, or orphaned worktrees are preserved.

Completion requires accepted required/completion nodes, no active or
review-pending nodes, all required reviews including the source Lead, no
unresolved legacy mailbox blocker, safe write
integration, settled resource accounting, durable cleanup disposition, and one
persisted synthesis with evidence, changed files, checks, risks, and cost.

## Project agents, scoring, and learning

Project identity prefers normalized Git remote identity, then Git common-dir,
then canonical workspace root. Profiles have immutable versions, origins
(`builtin`, `user`, `ephemeral`, `learned`), and lifecycle:

```text
candidate -> probation -> trusted -> dormant -> archived -> deleted
```

Routing first applies hard lifecycle, task, risk, capability, tool, Skill, MCP,
network, sandbox, and scope eligibility. It then recalls a bounded set and
keeps separate task-fit, verified-quality, trust, freshness, efficiency,
confidence, availability, and load dimensions. The aggregate weights are
32/22/14/8/8/10/3/3 percent respectively.

Only `eligible && recalled && !selected` evidence counts as a missed relevant
opportunity and applies a bounded ranking penalty. Irrelevant conversations do
not decay a specialist. Reaching the configured threshold creates a dormant
version with rollback metadata and an auditable reason.

Terminal/checkpoint runs create redacted bounded Episodes without raw
reasoning, credentials, secrets, full source, or unbounded logs. Durable
idempotent consolidation requires minimum verified episodes across distinct
sessions and classifies reusable material as Agent, Skill, or Graph Recipe
candidates. Evidence is untrusted data. Capability synthesis is least
privilege and cannot grant credentials, risky tools, broad writes, network,
MCP trust, provider authority, or sandbox expansion.

Learning modes are `off`, `suggest`, and `auto_candidate`. Automatic processing
never promotes directly to trusted. Agent candidates enter probation and need
cross-run evidence plus explicit user authority for promotion. Rejection,
rollback, merge, dormancy, archive, and deletion remain reversible/audited.

## Storage, recovery, and retention

```text
<dataDir>/graphs/<runId>/events.jsonl
<dataDir>/graphs/<runId>/snapshot.json
<dataDir>/graphs/thread-references.json
<dataDir>/graph-resources/write-coordinator.json
<dataDir>/graph-resources/worktrees/
<dataDir>/project-agents/<projectId>/registry.json
<dataDir>/graph-learning/<projectId>/learning.json
<dataDir>/artifacts/
```

Journals are checksummed append-only JSONL with monotonic sequence. Snapshots
are atomic; replay starts from the latest valid snapshot plus its suffix.
Large event payloads are content-addressed artifacts. Terminal journals compact
after the configured threshold.

Startup validates storage, expires leases, identifies missing worktrees,
reconciles queued/running/waiting attempts with child sessions, turns missing
children into orphaned/interrupted state, completes interrupted pause, and
returns incomplete synthesis to supervision before scheduling resumes.

Retention removes only expired terminal unreferenced runs. It compacts Episode,
job, reference, and audit history. `artifactDays` deletes only expired objects
that have no GraphRun/Episode reference and whose complete ownership history
shows Graph-only origins. Content shared through deduplication with Web or
ordinary tools, and legacy metadata with unknown owners, is retained
conservatively. Forks copy immutable high-water references without sharing live
execution. Archive pauses; delete fences, cancels, waits, records cleanup, then
removes thread references.

## HTTP and UI

All routes use the existing runtime Bearer authentication:

```text
POST /v1/graphs/validate
GET|POST /v1/graphs
GET /v1/graphs/diagnostics
GET /v1/graphs/:id
GET /v1/graphs/:id/events
GET /v1/graphs/:id/artifacts/:artifactId?offset=N|start_line=N
POST /v1/graphs/:id/start|pause|resume|cleanup
POST /v1/graphs/:id/cancel|retry|steer|patch|reviews

GET /v1/graph-projects/identity
GET|POST /v1/graph-projects/:projectId/agents...
GET /v1/graph-projects/:projectId/evidence|scores|routing
GET /v1/graph-projects/:projectId/candidates|episodes|jobs|audit
POST /v1/graph-projects/:projectId/candidates/:candidateId/action
POST /v1/graph-projects/:projectId/consolidate|explore
```

Mutations use command/idempotency keys and applicable expected sequence and
revision. Responses return persisted post-command truth. `graph_event` also
flows through the existing RuntimeEventRecorder/SSE thread cursor.

When enabled, the composer exposes `Direct | Graph`. The Graph workbench tab
renders phases, typed edges, loops, revisions, minimap/navigation, state and
resource summaries, phase collapse and an accessible list fallback. Node detail
includes the immutable assignment, permissions, tools/Skills, attempts, child
session, bounded paged artifacts, checks, reviews, writes, worktrees, and
errors. Run controls include rebind and versioned CAS GraphPatch operations in
addition to the ordinary lifecycle controls.

The source Lead remains visibly active while its GraphRun is nonterminal.
Plain-text input submitted in that conversation is persisted as Lead-targeted
Graph steering and wakes the same turn instead of admitting an unrelated turn.

Artifact preview uses only the authenticated, run-scoped bounded-read route:
the server verifies that the reference belongs to the GraphRun and the
renderer retains only the current byte/line page. Every mutation reconciles
persisted server truth. Status is not color-only; keyboard, ARIA, screen
reader, localization, and reduced-motion behavior are supported.

## Configuration, rollout, and safe disable

Configuration is under `agents.kun.graph`, grouped into `scheduler`, `context`,
`mailbox`, `supervision`, `writeIsolation`, `routing`, `learning`, and
`retention`. Compatibility defaults are:

```text
enabled=false
defaultStrategy=direct
rolloutStage=stable
learning.mode=off
writeIsolation.mode=serialize
writeIsolation.allowWorktrees=false
```

The product always runs the complete stable Graph capability set. The legacy
`rolloutStage` field remains readable for downgrade compatibility, but it no
longer gates loops, supervision, or learning. Those capabilities are controlled
only by their explicit settings; promotion still requires evidence and user
authority.

Safe disable sets `enabled=false` and `defaultStrategy=direct`. It stops new
creation, automatic supervision, and automatic learning, fences and pauses
nonterminal runs, and waits for active workers to settle. Existing runs and
learned data remain inspectable; do not delete the data directory as a rollback
mechanism.

Missing Graph settings migrate to compatibility defaults, so old workspaces,
threads, and ordinary child sessions are untouched. Before downgrading, disable
Graph and ensure no live worker remains.

For backup, pause/stop Kun and copy `graphs`, `graph-resources`,
`project-agents`, `graph-learning`, and referenced `artifacts` together.
Restore their relative layout and let startup recovery reconcile them. Never
restore a snapshot without its journal suffix or a registry without referenced
learning/artifact data.

## Incident triage

Start with `GET /v1/graphs/diagnostics`; it exposes sanitized aggregates, not
paths, prompts, secrets, or raw patches.

- Creation failure: check enablement, orchestration, and plan validation.
- Stuck blocked node: inspect required outcomes, the predecessor's source-Lead
  review, approved data-result packets, loop back-edge, and terminal failure.
- Worker does not stop: cancel and inspect worker/lease/worktree cleanup state.
- Write conflict: preserve the worktree and resolve through review/human merge.
- Corrupt journal: preserve the directory and restore a trusted snapshot plus
  suffix; never truncate the only copy.
- Orphan after restart: let recovery persist orphan/retry/supervision before
  manual retry.
- Running source Lead after restart: lifecycle recovery redelivers unseen
  supervision or terminal signals and resumes an interrupted continuation
  using the same durable turn identity.
- Bad learned candidate: reject or roll back and inspect provenance plus audit;
  do not edit registry JSON manually.

Cleanup is idempotent. Only accepted worktrees are automatically removed.
Unaccepted, conflicted, and orphaned worktrees stay `preserved` until their
contents are backed up or integrated.

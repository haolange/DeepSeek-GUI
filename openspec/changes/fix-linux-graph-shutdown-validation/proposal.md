## Why

The native Linux packaging job currently fails before `dist:linux` because the
Graph scheduler shutdown-recovery test treats durable file-backed cleanup as a
500 ms operation. Under normal Ubuntu CI load the scheduler completes correctly,
but the test reports a timeout and blocks all Linux packaging and release gates.

## What Changes

- Raise the shutdown completion assertion budget to 5 seconds on all platforms,
  matching the existing Windows allowance while retaining the test's 15-second
  overall timeout.
- Keep the late-admission shutdown scenario and durable interrupted-attempt
  assertions unchanged.
- Keep the extension release-gate fixture aligned with the AppImage smoke
  invocation contract by supplying the extracted AppDir and `AppRun` paths.
- Record every validated Windows installation source before invoking the old
  uninstaller, so fallback cleanup remains authorized after the old executable
  has been removed even when there is no unknown content to preserve.
- Surface opt-in Windows helper action/error diagnostics when the native smoke
  observes an unexpected installer exit, without changing normal installer
  output or behavior.
- Recover quoted registered uninstaller paths with installer-local NSIS parsing
  available during `customHeader`, avoiding both electron-builder's later macro
  include and an empty cross-process `ResolveSource` result.
- Give the three-process Windows preservation round-trip test a 15-second native
  startup budget while retaining all migration safety assertions.
- Remove only the fixed Kun HKCU install/uninstall registrations after a
  validated current-user to all-users transition succeeds.
- Remove the retired current-user Kun/legacy shortcuts while preserving the
  new all-users shortcut scope.
- Allow the deterministic supervision-liveness fixture its full configured
  Vitest budget on slower native Windows runners while retaining its bounded
  state waits and liveness assertions.
- Give root Vitest cases a 15-second per-test budget on Windows so synchronous
  native filesystem and PowerShell validation can complete under runner load.
- Bind Electron's `appData` special path to the already-created isolated desktop
  smoke directory before development smoke startup.
- Record the Linux Graph CI validation contract in a standalone OpenSpec
  capability.
- Do not change GraphScheduler production behavior, public APIs,
  electron-builder configuration, or user-facing release notes.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `linux-graph-ci-validation`: Native Linux Graph tests must tolerate durable
  shutdown persistence latency while still detecting a real shutdown deadlock,
  allowing the downstream Linux package and smoke gates to run.

### Modified Capabilities

None.

## Impact

- Test: `kun/src/graph/graph-scheduler-shutdown-recovery.test.ts`.
- Release-gate validation: `scripts/check-extension-release-gate.mjs` must pass
  the resolved AppImage extraction paths to the final desktop smoke fixture.
- Windows migration helper: `build/windows-installer-migration.ps1` records
  validated cleanup sources before the old uninstaller removes their identity
  executable.
- CI/release eligibility: the Graph platform suite can proceed to Linux
  AppImage/deb packaging and native smoke validation.
- No runtime protocol, API, dependency, or release-note changes.

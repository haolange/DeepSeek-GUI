## 3. Tests and verification

- [x] 3.1 Add focused positioning, preload/IPC security, provider switching, rendering, refresh, scrolling, and action tests.
- [x] 3.2 Run focused tests, typecheck, build, lint, and `git diff --check`; separate unrelated concurrent work.
- [x] 3.3 Commit only the tray-quota popover and OpenSpec files to local `develop`.

## 4. Windows hardening

- [x] 4.1 Pass platform context to the tray renderer and add a solid Fluent/forced-colors presentation for Windows.
- [x] 4.2 Harden tray anchoring for bottom/top taskbars, secondary-display origins, and temporarily empty tray bounds.
- [x] 4.3 Add Windows-focused geometry, renderer, typecheck, build, and 420×660 visual verification; commit only this follow-up to local `develop`.

## 5. Subscription quota source compatibility

- [x] 5.1 Correct ChatGPT/Codex preset recognition and honor the Codex CLI `CODEX_HOME` auth location.
- [x] 5.2 Add and test Kimi Code weekly and five-hour quota parsing from the official usages endpoint.
- [x] 5.3 Add and test Grok bearer-authenticated gRPC-web billing parsing with Grok CLI auth fallback and actionable upstream errors.
- [x] 5.4 Run focused tests, typecheck, build, lint, and `git diff --check`; commit the compatibility follow-up to local `develop`.

## 6. OpenCode Go local quota compatibility

- [x] 6.1 Add a shared, cross-platform, read-only OpenCode SQLite quota reader matching CodexBar's local cost windows.
- [x] 6.2 Register OpenCode Go in both Electron GUI and Kun/TUI quota services with an actionable missing-history state.
- [x] 6.3 Add focused local-reader, GUI-service, and Kun-service regression tests.
- [x] 6.4 Run focused tests, typecheck, build, lint, and `git diff --check`; commit only the OpenCode Go follow-up to local `develop`.

## 7. Compact workbench quota accordion

- [x] 7.1 Redesign workbench provider cards as compact, independently expandable disclosures that default to collapsed.
- [x] 7.2 Keep status, primary quota/error summary, dashboard action, and accessible disclosure semantics visible in collapsed rows.
- [x] 7.3 Add focused renderer tests for default collapse, independent expansion, and dashboard action behavior.
- [x] 7.4 Run focused tests, typecheck, build, lint, and `git diff --check`; commit only the accordion follow-up to local `develop`.

## 8. Group unavailable workbench providers

- [x] 8.1 Partition missing-credential, request-error, and unsupported providers into separate status groups while leaving available quota rows directly visible.
- [x] 8.2 Make populated status groups accessible disclosures that default to collapsed and show their provider counts.
- [x] 8.3 Add focused renderer tests for classification, default collapse, independent group expansion, and nested provider details.
- [x] 8.4 Run focused tests, typecheck, build, lint, and `git diff --check`; commit only the status-group follow-up to local `develop`.

## 9. Concise TUI quota command

- [x] 9.1 Make `/usage` the canonical TUI provider-quota command while retaining `/quota` and `/provider ...` aliases.
- [x] 9.2 Update command autocomplete, palette metadata, and parser regression coverage.
- [x] 9.3 Run focused Kun tests, typecheck, build, lint, and `git diff --check`; commit only this command follow-up to local `develop`.

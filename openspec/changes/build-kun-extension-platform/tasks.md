- [x] 10.3 Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run build:kun`, `npm run build`, and documentation/package validation with baseline failures separated.
- [x] 10.4 Validate packaged macOS, Windows, and Linux resources and smoke local package install, Webview, Agent tool, headless tool, and custom provider flows.
  - 2026-07-12 native macOS arm64 evidence: the final `Kun-0.1.0-mac-arm64.dmg` (SHA-256 `23e0f106ae68923b8a53af44fbd8026fb75551174c6d7a541261900688785a2e`) was mounted read-only and its contained `Kun.app` passed `codesign --verify --deep --strict`. The packaged runtime completed `.kunx` install, View Session, headless tool, Agent-to-extension-tool round trip, custom Provider/account streaming, diagnostics, and uninstall directly from the mounted artifact.
  - The mounted DMG's self-contained `Kun.app/Contents/MacOS/Kun` also passed the native Chromium desktop smoke: contribution discovery/click, isolated `kun-extension://` guest loading, body marker and narrow preload bridge, Theme/View-state round trips, host-global isolation, blocked network egress, and popup denial. The smoke used an isolated HOME/userData and left no managed runtime/CDP listener behind.
  - This local artifact is ad-hoc signed (`TeamIdentifier` absent), not Developer ID signed or notarized. Its successful native execution closes the local package/runtime behavior check but does not substitute for the release workflow's signed/notarized, commit-bound macOS artifact and verification record.
  - A translated Linux x64 diagnostic run (Ubuntu 22 amd64 under Docker Desktop/Rosetta, Node 22/npm 10) built the AppImage after exposing and fixing clean-bootstrap, lockfile, and Electron 43/GCC native-rebuild blockers. The final `linux-unpacked` package passed the full packaged backend and Xvfb Chromium desktop smokes; the AppImage SHA-256 was `6dee60947358b65776771e1373874aff58b701ed124b27fe1d164f6e8225b4d9`. This is emulated evidence only, and the static x64 AppImage runtime could not execute on the arm64 translation host.
  - Native Linux PR, stable-release, and daily-prerelease jobs fail closed without disabling Chromium's modern sandbox. Before either desktop smoke, an artifact-independent block enables only available user-namespace kernel toggles on the ephemeral runner and requires `unshare --user --map-root-user /bin/true`. Linux `afterPack` renames the real ELF payload to `<executable>.electron-bin` and installs a fixed same-name launcher: GUI calls unconditionally prepend `--disable-setuid-sandbox`, while `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` CLI calls pass through unchanged; `--no-sandbox` is forbidden, retaining user-namespace and seccomp sandboxing. `appImage.executableArgs` covers only `.desktop`, not direct AppImage execution. The unique final x86_64 AppImage extracts itself into a fresh empty directory; validation rejects symlink or containment escapes for `AppRun`, resources, embedded `app.asar`, launcher, ELF payload, and the single root desktop entry, and requires `Exec=AppRun --disable-setuid-sandbox --no-first-run %U`. Validated resources come only from that artifact and no external `app.asar` is appended; the GUI smoke itself injects no sandbox flag, scrubs inherited `APPDIR`/`APPIMAGE`, sets `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`, and directly launches the final AppImage. Node orchestration uses `shell: false`; the artifact launcher itself is a fixed `/bin/sh` script whose content is checked exactly. Extraction, synchronous CLI, CDP, and cleanup stages are individually bounded, while the CI AppImage step has a separate 10-minute disaster bound rather than claiming one strict local end-to-end deadline. Future deb/rpm or `app.relaunch()` paths must re-enter the launcher or preserve the flag because `process.execPath` points at the renamed payload. Evidence generation/upload remain ordered after the Xvfb smoke. Self-extraction avoids a FUSE dependency but does not prove FUSE-mounted or installer behavior. This is executable CI coverage, not local native evidence until a commit-bound Linux x64 runner result and artifact are recorded.
  - Non-publishing PR validation has native macOS, Windows, and Linux package jobs behind the test gate. Each platform builds its final artifact, completes the packaged backend and host-native Chromium smoke (plus final AppImage launch on Linux), then generates a strict `extension-native-evidence-<platform>.json` bound to the full commit, GitHub run/attempt, canonical artifact bytes, and SHA-256 before upload. Stable and daily workflows produce and require the same evidence files.
  - 2026-07-12 native PR evidence: draft PR `#867` run `29180466710` passed the test gate and all three package jobs. The evidence binds synthetic merge `c7d6183c795ac9f48594ba13aa844244d63912c5` to base `a6f5a386c9410eec7ae37284883d1392a4ae63d9` and head `2c97138521dee1344efbdbc49834c8043c55d72f`. Linux artifact `8256309294` contains `Kun-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (277,500,551 bytes, SHA-256 `1a98f5e9550d46ee70cfc4af70fae521c4c3df8f65d2604921f12095ada3c57c`) after backend, user-namespace, `linux-unpacked` Chromium, and direct final-AppImage Chromium smokes. Windows artifact `8256338930` contains `Kun-0.1.0-win-x64.exe` (242,085,540 bytes, SHA-256 `7bcd6315f37b3029f8a7ba6ab01e659706e0e1e75d15b125445ee3925571eeb4`) after backend and host-native Chromium smokes. macOS artifact `8256338690` contains arm64 DMG/ZIP (271,822,477 / 277,868,705 bytes, SHA-256 `e4a835e25d66f97d034eb1a169f09f684aa70bfb53e189ff015412427fcf7dad` / `ae0884cbaffdf1571f5fcbd3935106eaf7e77df4de04e1056af015171a412fee`) and x64 DMG/ZIP (275,400,575 / 281,592,764 bytes, SHA-256 `9bef7424e5cfcac403e7af0b47b9eb5b84818d69e22ba874d33c76ebe1ecefa8` / `c2e09d2c1e69d35a3039d405971e41b1e834c5a203c7c0c302a7dc27ceeb0dd9`) after both backend smokes and host-native Chromium smoke. CodeQL run `29180465719` also passed. The PR macOS artifacts are intentionally ad-hoc signed, not a substitute for the protected stable signing/notarization path.
  - Remaining formal release evidence is limited to the protected Developer ID signed/notarized macOS stable path and final human/reviewer sign-off; workflow ordering and failure propagation are already enforced by the release gate.
- [ ] 10.5 Remove the internal platform gate, verify current-plus-previous API compatibility and legacy-system non-regression, and complete the public release checklist.
  - The internal gate is removed, current-plus-previous API fixtures and legacy regression suites pass, and the automated public release gate passes. Daily prereleases and local release helpers now fail closed before upload/promotion, and a generated-artifact-free Node 22/npm 10 checkout completes `npm ci`. Native PR package evidence is recorded above; final checklist sign-off remains pending the protected Developer ID signed/notarized macOS stable release plus human review of installation, accessibility, and system Credential Store behavior.
